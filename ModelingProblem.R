# Modeling Problem: 
#  Using the given data set create a repeat sales index using the Case and Shiller methodology as described in the attached paper.
#  NOTE: This dataset was created in the following way from a database of property transactions.
#  	Every transaction is matched to prior sales subject to two things:
#                        That the PropertyIDs are match
#                        and that the matched transaction occured before the current observation.
#                This causes a problem in that every transaction is matched not just to the transaction immediately prior, 
#                but to transactions prior to that. 
#   Cleaning may be required.
#
#   Comment and structure your code to be easily followed.

  X[,j] <- ifelse(data$t0==times[j], -1, X[,j])
}

# Step 1: Fit BMN model
fit1 <- lm(dy ~ X + 0) # BMN regression: fit logarithmic price delta with logarithmic index delta
e <- residuals(fit1) # take the residuals
data$saletime <- data$t1 - data$t0 # compute interval time between sales
# Step 2: Fit residuals
fit2 <- lm(e^2 ~ data$saletime) # regress sqiared residuals against gap time
w <- fitted(fit2) # take fitted coefficients
w <- ifelse(w>0, 1/sqrt(w), 0) # make non-negative, take reciprocal of sqrt of fitted values - estimated standard deviations used
# Step 3: Weighted Least Squares regression
